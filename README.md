# Awesome interactive maps
A curated list of resources for interactive map developers. This collection focuses primarily on front-end tools and libraries based on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and similar web technologies.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jehb/awesome-interactive-maps/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how you can help improve this list. No closed sourced tools or libraries, please.

Two other lists, one for server-side resources, and another for desktop GIS tools, are forthcoming.

## Core libraries

* [Cesium](https://cesiumjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for creating 3D globes and 2D maps in a web browser without a plugin, using WebGL for hardware-accelerated graphics, and is cross-platform, cross-browser, and tuned for dynamic-data visualization.
* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) is a leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 33 KB of JS, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.
