# Contribution Guidelines

* Please double-check your spelling and grammar before making your pull request.
* Do me a favor and make sure your submission isn't already on the list (no duplicates).
* Feel free to make new sections or reorganize content as appropriate.
* Rather than playing favorites, let's keep the lists alphabetized.
* Please do not add links to any closed source products or libraries, or to paid learning resources. Let's keep this list free and open.
* Please submit a pull request to contribute (no emails, please). If you're not familiar with GitHub, this is a great time to learn.
* By submitting a pull request, you agree that your contribution will be made available under a CC0 license (basically, public domain).
